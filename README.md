# MultiAgentAllocationTransit

Accompanying code repository for the paper 'Efficient Multi-Drone Delivery Using Transit Networks' ([ArXiv]()).


Here is an example with 80 agents in San Francisco. The black pentagons are depots, the grey rectangles are delivery
locations, blue circles are drones flying, and red circles are drones riding on transit. We
do not render the actual transit vehicles (buses) for clarity. _Locations are randomly generated within a bounding
box, and some of them may be slightly offshore_.
